# MemoryCraft

Welcome to MemoryCraft, a delightful Minecraft-themed memory challenge game! This project started as a fun side venture, a sandbox for me to delve into the depths of ReactJS and TailwindCSS. It’s not just a game—it's a representation of my learning journey.

Experience MemoryCraft live. The application is deployed and available for use at: [MemoryCraft Deployment](https://memorycraft.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Singleplayer Mode**: A personal test of memory, featuring a grid of Minecraft items to match.
- **Adjustable Difficulty**: Begin with a 'Peaceful' mode and challenge yourself as you progress.
- **How to play**: Simplest of instructions.
- **Open-Source**: See my spaghetti code in flesh!

## Core Learnings
- Explored **ReactJS**: Reaffirming my knowledge in hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` and create responsive/dynamic UI components.
- Navigation using **React-Router-DOM**: Learned about `react-router-dom` and properly used to the best of my ability `createBrowserRouter`.
- Styled with **TailwindCSS**: Embracing the utility-first approach to use Minecraft's design and pleasing aesthetic.
- Established **Proper File Structuring**: Keeping the project organized and maintainable.
